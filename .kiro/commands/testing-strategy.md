description: "Action: Define and execute testing strategy for Chess Endgame Training features and fixes."
---

## Scope

Testing approach for Chess Endgame Training covering:
• **Core Chess Logic**: Position validation, move generation, game state
• **Engine Integration**: Stockfish and Syzygy responses
• **User Interface**: Board interaction, settings, progress tracking
• **Localization**: Multi-language support (en, es, ru, tr)
• **Performance**: Loading times, memory usage, responsiveness

## Objective

Ensure chess training functionality works correctly by:
• **Validating Chess Logic**: Moves, positions, and game rules
• **Testing Engine Integration**: Stockfish analysis and Syzygy tablebase queries
• **Verifying User Experience**: Smooth gameplay and progress tracking
• **Confirming Localization**: All languages display correctly
• **Checking Performance**: Acceptable loading and response times

## Chess-Specific Test Categories

### 1. Core Chess Functionality
**Position Loading**:
- [ ] FEN strings parse correctly
- [ ] Board displays accurate position
- [ ] Piece placement matches FEN

**Move Validation**:
- [ ] Legal moves accepted
- [ ] Illegal moves rejected
- [ ] Special moves (castling, en passant, promotion)
- [ ] Check and checkmate detection

**Game State**:
- [ ] Move history tracking
- [ ] Undo/redo functionality
- [ ] Position analysis accuracy

### 2. Engine Integration
**Stockfish Testing**:
- [ ] Engine loads and initializes
- [ ] Analysis requests return results
- [ ] Depth and time parameters work
- [ ] Engine suggestions are reasonable

**Syzygy Testing**:
- [ ] Tablebase queries succeed
- [ ] Results match expected outcomes
- [ ] Fallback to Stockfish when needed
- [ ] Network timeout handling

### 3. User Interface
**Board Interaction**:
- [ ] Piece dragging works smoothly
- [ ] Click-to-move functions
- [ ] Board themes load correctly
- [ ] Piece styles display properly

**Progress Tracking**:
- [ ] Personal records save
- [ ] Statistics update correctly
- [ ] Google Drive sync works
- [ ] Settings persist across sessions

### 4. Localization
**Multi-language Support**:
- [ ] All UI text translates
- [ ] No missing translation keys
- [ ] Text fits in UI elements
- [ ] Language switching works

**Turkish Localization** (Current Focus):
- [ ] All strings translated
- [ ] Chess terminology accurate
- [ ] UI layout accommodates text length
- [ ] Date/number formatting correct

## Testing Process

### 1. Pre-Development Testing
1. **Baseline Test**: Verify current functionality works
2. **Regression Check**: Ensure no existing features broken
3. **Environment Setup**: Test in development environment

### 2. Development Testing
1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual functions
2. **Integration Testing**: Test component interactions
3. **Manual Testing**: Play through typical user scenarios

### 3. Post-Development Testing
1. **Feature Testing**: New functionality works as expected
2. **Regression Testing**: Existing features still work
3. **Performance Testing**: No significant slowdowns
4. **Cross-browser Testing**: Works in major browsers

## Test Scenarios

### Typical User Journey
1. **Start Application**: App loads, displays home screen
2. **Select Category**: Navigate to endgame category
3. **Load Position**: Position displays correctly
4. **Make Moves**: Legal moves work, illegal moves rejected
5. **Get Analysis**: Engine provides move suggestions
6. **Complete Position**: Progress tracked and saved
7. **Change Settings**: Preferences persist
8. **Switch Language**: UI updates correctly

### Edge Cases
- **Network Issues**: Syzygy timeouts, offline mode
- **Invalid Positions**: Malformed FEN strings
- **Engine Failures**: Stockfish crashes or hangs
- **Memory Limits**: Large position databases
- **Browser Compatibility**: Older browsers, mobile devices

## Performance Benchmarks

**Loading Times**:
- App startup: < 3 seconds
- Position loading: < 1 second
- Engine analysis: < 5 seconds
- Settings changes: < 0.5 seconds

**Memory Usage**:
- Initial load: < 50MB
- After 30 minutes play: < 100MB
- No memory leaks over time

## Defect Reporting

**Critical Issues** (Fix immediately):
- Game won't start
- Positions won't load
- Moves rejected incorrectly
- Progress not saving

**High Priority** (Fix same day):
- Engine not responding
- UI elements broken
- Translation errors
- Performance degradation

**Medium Priority** (Fix within week):
- Minor UI issues
- Non-critical feature bugs
- Optimization opportunities

## Test Environment Setup

**Local Development**:
```bash
npm run dev
# Test in browser at localhost:5173
```

**Production Build**:
```bash
npm run build
npm run serve
# Test production build
```

**Mobile Testing**:
- Chrome DevTools mobile simulation
- Actual mobile devices when possible

## Success Criteria

**Feature Complete When**:
- [ ] All test scenarios pass
- [ ] No critical or high priority bugs
- [ ] Performance meets benchmarks
- [ ] All languages display correctly
- [ ] User can complete typical chess training session

**Release Ready When**:
- [ ] Full regression test passes
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility confirmed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

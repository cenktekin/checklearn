## Sprint Planning Process

### Pre-Planning (Day before sprint)

1. **Review Current State**:
   - Complete project assessment
   - Check tasks.md for active items
   - Test core functionality
   - Review user feedback/issues

2. **Prepare Backlog**:
   - Update task priorities
   - Break down large tasks
   - Estimate effort levels
   - Identify dependencies

3. **Assess Capacity**:
   - Available development time
   - External commitments
   - Technical constraints
   - Review/testing time needed

### Sprint Planning Session (1-2 hours)

#### Phase 1: Goal Setting (30 minutes)

1. **Review Previous Sprint**:
   - What was completed?
   - What carried over?
   - Lessons learned?
   - User feedback received?

2. **Define Sprint Goal**:
   - Single, clear objective
   - User-focused outcome
   - Measurable success criteria
   - Aligned with project priorities

3. **Example Sprint Goals**:
   ```markdown
   ## Sprint Goal: Turkish Localization Completion
   **Objective**: Complete Turkish language support for Chess Endgame Training
   **Success Criteria**: 
   - All UI elements translated to Turkish
   - Chess terminology accurate and consistent
   - Mobile layout works with Turkish text
   - Language switching functions properly
   ```

#### Phase 2: Task Selection (45 minutes)

1. **Prioritize by Value**:
   - User impact (high/medium/low)
   - Technical importance (critical/important/nice-to-have)
   - Effort required (small/medium/large)
   - Dependencies (none/some/many)

2. **Chess Training Specific Priorities**:

   **High Value Tasks**:
   - Core chess functionality improvements
   - Engine performance optimization
   - Critical bug fixes
   - Localization completion
   - User progress enhancements

   **Medium Value Tasks**:
   - UI polish and improvements
   - Additional features
   - Performance optimizations
   - Code quality improvements

   **Low Value Tasks**:
   - Nice-to-have features
   - Technical debt cleanup
   - Documentation updates
   - Experimental features

3. **Capacity Planning**:
   ```markdown
   ## Sprint Capacity Estimation
   **Available Time**: 40 hours
   **Task Breakdown**:
   - Large tasks (8+ hours): 1-2 maximum
   - Medium tasks (4-6 hours): 2-3 items
   - Small tasks (1-2 hours): 4-6 items
   **Buffer**: 20% for unexpected issues
   ```

#### Phase 3: Task Breakdown (30 minutes)

1. **Break Down Selected Tasks**:
   - Ensure tasks are 1-2 hours maximum
   - Define clear success criteria
   - Identify testing requirements
   - Note any dependencies

2. **Example Task Breakdown**:
   ```markdown
   ### Large Task: "Complete Turkish Localization"
   **Broken into**:
   - [ ] Translate core UI elements (2h)
   - [ ] Translate chess terminology (2h)
